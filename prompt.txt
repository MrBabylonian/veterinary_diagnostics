ðŸ§ª Prompt (English version)

Task: Extract hematologic (blood test) data from a veterinary laboratory report provided as one or more PDF pages converted to images.
The report may span multiple pages; images are provided in order.

ðŸ“Œ Your goal

Return only the hematologic values in the following strict JSON structure:

{
  "quantitative_hemogram": {
    "PARAMETER NAME": {
      "value": number or null,
      "unit": "unit exactly as written in the report" or null,
      "ref_range": "min - max"
    }
  },
  "morphology": {
    "erythrocytic": {
      "Parameter": true | false | "+" | "++" | null
    },
    "leukocytic": {
      "Parameter": true | false | "+" | "++" | null
    },
    "platelet": {
      "Parameter": true | false | "+" | "++" | null
    }
  }
}

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Collect all hematology values appearing anywhere in the report, even if split across pages.

Include only tests that are visibly present in the images â€” do not add common or expected tests that arenâ€™t shown.

If a parameter appears but has no value or unit â†’ use null.

Do not infer or invent values.

If a morphology parameter is listed without modifiers â†’ set its value to true.

ðŸ”¹ Quantitative hemogram rules

Copy parameter names exactly as printed (including accents, symbols, case, punctuation).

Copy units exactly as written (e.g., %, pg, fL, g/dL, thousand/ÂµL, million/ÂµL).

Do not translate, abbreviate, or normalize names or units.

If the unit is adjacent to the numeric value, separate them logically in your output.

Do not confuse units with the reference range.

If the unit is missing â†’ set "unit": null.

Preserve the logical order (e.g., RBC â†’ HGB â†’ HCT â†’ MCV â†’ MCH â†’ MCHC â†’ RDW â†’ â€¦).

If a row has a name but no numeric value â†’ "value": null.

ðŸ”¹ Morphology section rules

Divide into three subsections: "erythrocytic", "leukocytic", and "platelet".

Possible values:

true: parameter appears but without modifiers

false: explicitly marked as absent

"+", "++", "+++": if those marks appear

null: parameter not mentioned at all

If a parameter is not mentioned, set null. Use false only when explicitly marked absent/negative.

ðŸ“Œ Output requirements

Return a valid, well-formatted JSON object only.

No text, commentary, or explanation outside the JSON.

Follow the structure exactly.
